<p>    
    Have you ever had data, especially graphs, that you needed to visualize but didn't want to get
    into the hassle of installing, integrating and maintaining a software package for layouting graphs?
    Even worse, the software package that you installed does not give an optimal result and so you tried others
    or had them running in parallel and at the end you gave up because it was just too much work?

    What if you could just call <code>graph.layout([type], [name], [options])</code> and that's it?

    Sometimes, methods that you think you know well might surprise you and bring you
    headaches if you don't read the documentation carefully. One of these methods is 
    the JavaScript String.replace method.

<p>    
    The <a href="http://jointjs.com">JointJS</a> diagramming library contains a not-yet-documented standalone mini library that implements many useful geometry operations.
    This post shows all the primitives that the geometry library exposes. The geometry library does not have
    any dependencies, is AMD complient and can be used outside of JointJS.

<p>    
    JointJS is a diagramming library that focuses on rendering and interacting with diagrams.
    This post shows how to integrate JointJS with Dagre, the directed graph layout engine for JavaScript, in order to automatically
    render and layout directed graphs.</p>

<p>    
    Do you also like the moments when you browse through the code you wrote years ago? I've 
    just had one of these and discovered a tiny JavaScript library which I wrote about five years ago that turns your HTML table elements into
    interactive tables with sorting, filtering and paging and couple of visual effects as well.
    A JavaScript library that runs on Firefox 2, IE 6 and other ancient browsers without
    any external help. No jQuery, Prototype or any other help. I decided to share my excitment with you and
    so I translated documentation and demo from Czech to English and here it is.</p>

<p>
    Sometimes you want
    to show the user a URL that is nicely visually structured. This happens especially in
    cases where it is important to focus on e.g. query parameters of an URL. I had this need
    and so I created <b><a href="http://github.com/DavidDurman/urlhighlight">urlhighlight</a></b>, a very little (151 loc) JavaScript function that takes a URL as a parameter
    and returns HTML that wraps components of that URL. These components can be then styled in CSS.

<p>
    JSON format became quite a standard format for data exchange. Its simple syntax, JavaScript compatibility and human 
    readability are probably the reasons for its wide adoption. I work with JSON on a daily basis and therefore
    had a need for an online JSON editor. I tried plenty of them that are out there but no one provided a 
    component that I could use in my own applications. The reason why I needed such a component is for UI prototyping.
    Sometimes you need a replacement for a future UI component that you haven't built yet. Such a component
    is just part of the UI and allows the user to change some properties that are represented internally 
    as a plain JavaScript object. That's how <a href="http://jsonmate.com">JSONMate</a> and its core <a href="https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiJsonEditor">jQuery JSON editor plugin</a> have born.

    There is plenty of color picker components on the web but very few of them are built with pure JavaScript, 
    without using images, Flash or 1px divs. Moreover, it's difficult to find one that works
    on mobile devices as well. Let me introduce a plain JavaScript color picker written in 300 lines
    of code including comments. Discover SVG!</p>
