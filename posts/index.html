    JSON format became quite a standard format for data exchange. Its simple syntax, JavaScript compatibility and human 
    readability are probably the reasons for its wide adoption. I work with JSON on a daily basis and therefore
    had a need for an online JSON editor. I tried plenty of them that are out there but no one provided a 
    component that I could use in my own applications. The reason why I needed such a component is for UI prototyping.
    Sometimes you need a replacement for a future UI component that you haven't built yet. Such a component
    is just part of the UI and allows the user to change some properties that are represented internally 
    as a plain JavaScript object. That's how <a href="http://jsonmate.com">JSONMate</a> and its core <a href="https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiJsonEditor">jQuery JSON editor plugin</a> have born.

    There is plenty of color picker components on the web but very few of them are built with pure JavaScript, 
    without using images, Flash or 1px divs. Moreover, it's difficult to find one that works
    on mobile devices as well. Let me introduce a plain JavaScript color picker written in 300 lines
    of code including comments. Discover SVG!</p>
