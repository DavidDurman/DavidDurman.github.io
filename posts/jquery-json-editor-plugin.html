    <h1>JSON editor jQuery plugin</h1>

<p>
    JSON format became quite a standard format for data exchange. Its simple syntax, JavaScript compatibility and human 
    readability are probably the reasons for its wide adoption. I work with JSON on a daily basis and therefore
    had a need for an online JSON editor. I tried plenty of them that are out there but no one provided a 
    component that I could use in my own applications. The reason why I needed such a component is for UI prototyping.
    Sometimes you need a replacement for a future UI component that you haven't built yet. Such a component
    is just part of the UI and allows the user to change some properties that are represented internally 
    as a plain JavaScript object. That's how <a href="http://jsonmate.com">JSONMate</a> and its core <a href="https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiJsonEditor">jQuery JSON editor plugin</a> have born.

<h3>Example first</h3>
<p>
                <pre><code>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jsoneditor.css"/&gt;

&lt;div id="editor" class="json-editor"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;pre id="json"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.jsoneditor.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var json = {
       "string": "foo",
       "number": 5,
       "array": [1, 2, 3],
       "object": {
         "property": "value",
         "subobj": {
         "arr": ["foo", "ha"],
         "numero": 1
       }
    };
    $('#editor').jsonEditor(json, { change: function() {
        $('#json').html(JSON.stringify(json));
    } });
&lt;/script&gt;
                </code></pre>
            </p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p><code>jsonEditor(jsonObject, optionsObject)</code> expects a JSON object as the first argument.
    Whenever the user changes a property of the JSON object through the visual tree viewer/editor, 
    the JSON object gets altered as well and the <code>change()</code> callback of the <code>optionsObject</code>
    is triggered.<p>
<p>
    The <code>jsoneditor.css</code>
    stylesheet is a default styling of the editor. The stylesheet is self-explanatory.
    <code>.json-editor</code> is the wrapper for the whole component, <code>.item</code> contains a
    <code>.property</code> and <code>.value</code> input fields which correspond to a property and value
    of the JSON object. <code>.item</code> contains other items in case of a nested object.
    <code>.editing</code> is a class items gain when their respective input boxes gain focus.
    <code>.expander</code> is a <code>span</code> element representing the button for expanding
    nested objects. Feel free to adapt the styling for your needs.</p>
<h3>Browser support</h3>
<p>
    The JSON editor should be compatible with all browsers jQuery supports.
    However, it's been tested only in IE7+, FF3+, Chrome and Safari. Please note
    that the <a href="https://raw.github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/master/json2.js"><code>json2</code></a> polyfill has to be included for browsers that do not
    support the JSON object natively.
