    <h1>Layout as a Service: Visualize your data in many ways</h1>
    <span class="date">January 27th, 2014</span>

<p>
    Have you ever had data, especially graphs, that you needed to visualize but didn't want to get
    into the hassle of installing, integrating and maintaining a software package for <b>layouting graphs</b>?
    Even worse, the software package that you installed does not give an optimal result and so you tried others
    or had them running in parallel and at the end you gave up because it was just too much work?

    What if you could just call <code>graph.layout([type], [name], [options])</code> and that's it?
</p>

<p>
    For all these reasons and for the possibility of offering a large number of layout algorithms we decided
    to launch a <em>Layout as a Service</em>. <b>Sign up at <a href="http://getthislayout.com">getthislayout.com</a></b>. We plan
    to offer <b>more than 25 layout algorithms</b> accessible through a <b>REST interface</b>. Moreover, we'll be releasing
    a <a href="http://jointjs.com">JointJS</a> plugin so that you can layout and visualize your data with a
    single function call. Additionally, we plan to implement a layout picker widget making it easy to integrate
    different layouts to any user interface.
</p>

<p>
     GetThisLayout will offer a great range of layouts for both <b>directed and undirectd graphs</b> but also for
     box packing and trees. This is more than any software package can offer.

</div>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>
    The usage is simple. You POST a graph to the GetThisLayout endpoint and it returns back the same
    graph but now with coordinates for both nodes and link vertices. We'd like to start with <b>JSON
    input format</b> but would like to extend it with other formats like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML">GraphML</a>, 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGML">OGML</a> and others. The output format will again start with JSON but
    will be later extended with others (even static images). If you choose <a href="http://jointjs.com">JointJS</a>
    for displaying and interacting with graphs, you can take advantage of the plugins that will accompany the service.
