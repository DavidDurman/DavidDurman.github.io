<p>

    In this post, I'm proposing an alternative way of dealing with asynchronous and non-trivial behaviour 
    of JavaScript applications in both the client (browsers) and server side environments.

</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://drawdotio.appspot.com/embed.js"></script>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

    Asynchronous, event-driven programming is the heart of JavaScript applications be it in browsers or NodeJS.
    Programmers deal with future values on a daily basis. 

</p>

<h2>Existing, adopted patterns</h2>

<p>

    There are many existing and widely adopted approaches for dealing with the complexity that asynchronous 
    applications bring. Some of them include:

</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Continuation-Passing style</b>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4586052.js"></script>
    </li>
    <li><b>Promises</b>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/4586064.js"></script>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What's wrong with these patterns?</h2>

<p>

    There is nothing wrong with any of the styles if you use them properly. Every scenario deserves its
    own attention. 
</p>
<p>

    <em>Continuation-passing</em> style is known to lead to a so called <q>callback hell</q>, i.e. your
    code tends to get a christmas tree-like structure, moving gradually from left to right. That makes
    it quite difficult to read and figure out what it does. 
</p>
<p>
    <em>Promises</em>, on the other hand, solve
    this issue by introducing future values, that is values that you can work with even though they
    are not available yet. Once the values become available - get resolved, the callback mechanism that is hidden
    in the implementation of <em>Promises</em> passes them through the interface and you finally get the real data.
    <em>Promises</em> can also be combined into higher-order functions (map, reduce, ...) making it easier to
    work with lists of future values. <em>Promises</em> have been widely adopted in practice though many
    developers find them difficult to understand and they don't allow for modeling of more complex logic.

</p>

<h2>Alternative</h2>

<p>

    Statecharts are nothing new in the field of computer science. They have a strong formal foundation and
    have been discovered by David Harel in 1987 in its academic paper <em>Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems</em>.
    Later they have been redefined in xUML (Executable UML) and by Miro Samek in his work on Hierarchical State Machines.

</p>

<p>

    Let's look at an example of Statecharts in JavaScript:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4586070.js"></script>

<p> 

    The code above might look verbous. However, notice one important thing, the logic of synchronizing
    the events is completely hidden inside the state machine. That means that we can decouple the state machine
    from the code that uses it and use the same machine throughout our whole application.
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4586078.js"></script>

<p>

    Now why is this advantegous? First, we've seen that we can completely decouple the event logic from the actual
    code that leverages it. Secondly, Statecharts allow us to build complex, non-trivial logic while preserving
    understandability. Moreover, Statecharts have been developed in a way that they can be easilly
    visualized. This brings a tremendeous value in understanding what's going on. 
    Statecharts can also be easilly tested as they are completely separate components. Finally,
    they are very easy to debug as your Statechart can print out every state it goes through or is currently in.
