        Hi there, thanks for coming! My name is David Durman
        and I'm a JavaScript developer based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
        Some of my projects are in <a href="http://www.github.com/DavidDurman">Github</a>,
        you can also find me on <a href="http://nl.linkedin.com/in/daviddurman">LinkedIn</a> or

            <h2>A pure JavaScript color picker</h2>
            <p>Yes... you see it right, yet another color picker out there! 
                But what makes this one special over the others?</p>
            <p>
                Let me start to explain the usual way web based color pickers are built.
                95% of them use one or more images to show the color palette, the rest
                is built with flash. That seems to be logical, right?</p>
            <p>
                But is this image/flash/CSS downloading overhead really necessary?
                And what if you want to change the dimensions of the color picker?</p>
            <p>
                I asked myself these two questions when building a web based diagramming
                editor on top of my <a href="http://www.jointjs.com">JointJS</a> library.
                I tried plenty of color pickers but no one suited my needs. So I decided
                to build a new one. The result is 4.3KB of minified JavaScript without
                any dependency on an external library. It's a standalone piece of
                code which you can just append to your other JavaScript reducing
                unnecessary server requests. It works in all major browsers (IE7+, FF3.5+, Chrome 4+, Safari 4+, Opera 9+,
                might also work in IE6 but I didn't want to get my hands dirty, so I haven't tried).
                The dimensions and position of the picker and slide area can be fully customized
                in CSS just like any other div element.</p>
            <p>
                And what is the magic behind? Sorry, no magic, just normal (usually forgotten)
                SVG/VML. The size of vector objects created are set to 100% width/height so
                they are adjusted according to the outer divs. Registered callback is invoked
                whenever the color changes and it is passed a color in hexadecimal, hsv and rgb formats.
                That's it.</p>
